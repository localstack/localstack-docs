## Introduction

[dbt (data build tool)](https://www.getdbt.com/) is a transformation workflow tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouses by writing modular SQL. dbt handles version control, documentation, and modularity for data transformations.

The Snowflake emulator supports dbt, allowing you to develop and test your dbt models locally without connecting to a production Snowflake instance.

## Configuring dbt

In this guide, you will learn how to configure dbt to interact with the Snowflake emulator.

### Install dbt

First, install dbt with the Snowflake adapter:

```bash
pip install dbt-snowflake
```

### Configure dbt Profile

Create or modify your `profiles.yml` file (typically located in `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`) to include the connection details for the Snowflake emulator:

```yaml showLineNumbers
localstack_snowflake:
  outputs:
    dev:
      account: localstack
      host: snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud
      port: 4566
      database: test
      password: test
      role: test
      schema: public
      threads: 1
      type: snowflake
      user: test
      warehouse: test
  target: dev
```

### Test the Connection

To verify your dbt configuration is working correctly with the Snowflake emulator, run:

```bash
dbt debug --profile localstack_snowflake
```

You should see output indicating a successful connection to the Snowflake emulator.

### Running dbt Commands

Once configured, you can run standard dbt commands against the Snowflake emulator.

### Example dbt Model

Here's a simple example of a dbt model which creates a table with a single row that you can use to test the integration:

```sql showLineNumbers
-- models/example_model.sql
{{ config(materialized='table') }}

SELECT 
    1 as id,
    'test' as name
```

### Example Tests

You can test your models using dbt's generic tests.

Add the following to your `models/schema.yml`:

```yaml showLineNumbers
version: 2

models:
  - name: example_model
    description: "A simple example model with generic tests"
    columns:
      - name: id
        description: "The primary key for this table"
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: name
        description: "The name field"
        tests:
          - not_null
```

You can run all models and tests with the following commands:

```bash
# Run all models
dbt run --profile localstack_snowflake

# Run tests
dbt test --profile localstack_snowflake
```

### Project Structure

A typical dbt project structure when working with the Snowflake emulator might look like this:

```
my_dbt_project/
├── dbt_project.yml
├── models/
│   ├── example_model.sql
│   └── schema.yml
└── README.md
```

Example `dbt_project.yml`:

```yaml showLineNumbers
name: 'my_dbt_project'
version: '1.0.0'
config-version: 2

profile: 'localstack_snowflake'

model-paths: ["models"]
test-paths: ["tests"]
analysis-paths: ["analyses"]
macro-paths: ["macros"]

target-path: "target"
clean-targets:
    - "target"
    - "dbt_packages"

models:
  my_dbt_project:
    materialized: table
```

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Keep your dbt models and configurations in version control
2. **Testing**: Write tests for your models to ensure data quality
3. **Documentation**: Document your models using dbt's built-in documentation features
4. **Modularity**: Break down complex transformations into smaller, reusable models

:::note
It's a good practice to always test your dbt models locally with the Snowflake emulator before deploying to production, to save time and resources.
