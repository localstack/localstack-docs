IoT Analytics will be [retired on 15 December 2025](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/iotanalytics-end-of-support.html).
It will be removed from LocalStack soon after this date.

## Introduction

IoT Analytics is a managed service that enables you to collect, store, process, and analyze data generated by your IoT devices.
It provides a set of tools to build IoT applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.

LocalStack allows you to use the IoT Analytics APIs to create and manage channels, data stores, and pipelines in your local environment.
The supported APIs are available on our [API Coverage section](#api-coverage), which provides information on the extent of IoT Analytics integration with LocalStack.

## Getting started

This guide is designed for users new to Iot Analytics and assumes basic knowledge of the AWS CLI and our [`awslocal`](https://github.com/localstack/awscli-local) wrapper script.

Start your LocalStack container using your preferred method.
We will demonstrate how to create a channel, data store, and pipeline within IoT Analytics using LocalStack.

### Create a channel

You can create a channel using the [`CreateChannel`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/APIReference/API_CreateChannel.html) API.
Run the following command to create a channel named `mychannel`:

```bash
awslocal iotanalytics create-channel --channel-name mychannel
```

You can use the [`DescribeChannel`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeChannel.html) API to check the status of the channel:

```bash
awslocal iotanalytics describe-channel --channel-name mychannel
```

```bash title="Output"
{
    "channel": {
        "name": "mychannel",
        "status": "ACTIVE"
    }
}
```

### Create a data store

You can create a data store using the [`CreateDatastore`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDatastore.html) API.
Run the following command to create a data store named `mydatastore`:

```bash
awslocal iotanalytics create-datastore --datastore-name mydatastore
```

You can use the [`DescribeDatastore`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDatastore.html) API to check the status of the data store:

```bash
awslocal iotanalytics describe-datastore --datastore-name mydatastore
```

```bash title="Output"
{
    "datastore": {
        "name": "mydatastore",
        "status": "ACTIVE"
    }
}
```

### Create a pipeline

You can create a pipeline using the [`CreatePipeline`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/APIReference/API_CreatePipeline.html) API.
Run the following command to create a pipeline named `mypipeline`:

```bash
awslocal iotanalytics create-pipeline --cli-input-json file://mypipeline.json
```

The `mypipeline.json` file contains the following content:

```json showLineNumbers
{
    "pipelineName": "mypipeline",
    "pipelineActivities": [
        {
            "channel": {
                "name": "mychannelactivity",
                "channelName": "mychannel",
                "next": "mystoreactivity"
            }
        },
        {
            "datastore": {
                "name": "mystoreactivity",
                "datastoreName": "mydatastore"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

You can use the [`DescribePipeline`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/APIReference/API_DescribePipeline.html) API to check the status of the pipeline:

```bash
awslocal iotanalytics describe-pipeline  --pipeline-name mypipeline
```

```bash title="Output"
{
    "pipeline": {
        "name": "mypipeline"
    }
}
```

## Current Limitations

The IoT Analytics service provider is currently mocked in LocalStack, and the service does not interface with the IoT Core service.
